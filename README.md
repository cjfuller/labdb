# Introduction

Labdb is a web-based laboratory database system for tracking objects in a biology lab, like plasmids, oligonucleotides, bacterial strains, etc.

# Installation / Configuration

(TODO: old instructions were very out of date and have been removed.  See `deploy.rb` for how this is currently deployed to heroku.  Use `devserver.sh` to run locally.  You will need to `bundle install` and `rake db:create` if this is your first time running locally.)
