- By default, the plasmid map displays unique restriction sites and regional features like tags, protease sites, etc.

- When restriction sites are crowded together, their labels are hidden and a numbered black arc is shown above the set of sites.  Mouseover an arc to see all the sites contained in it.

- Mouseover any regional feature on the plasmid to see more information.

- To show or hide sites for a restriction enzyme, enter it (case-sensitive) into the box and press the appropriate button.
